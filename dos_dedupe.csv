(Sec. 115) This section prohibits DHS from (1) processing the entry of non-U.S. nationals ( aliens under federal law) arriving in between ports of entry; (2) providing funds to nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) that facilitate or encourage unlawful activity; or (3) providing funds to NGOs that provide certain services, such as lodging or immigration legal services, to inadmissible non-U.S. nationals who enter the United States. (Sec. 116) This section requires DHS to ensure that CBP is, within 14 days of this bill's enactment, fully compliant with federal DNA and biometric collection requirements at U.S. land borders. (Sec. 117) This section requires CBP to periodically review and update, as necessary, manuals and policies related to inspections at ports of entry to ensure the uniformity of inspection practices to effectively detect illegal activity along the border, such as the smuggling of drugs and humans. (Sec. 118) This section requires CBP to publish information monthly about CBP encounters with non-U.S. nationals, including the total number of encounters and the nationalities of the individuals encountered. (Sec. 119) This section requires CBP to, within seven days of this bill's enactment, certify to Congress that CBP has real-time access to the criminal history databases of all countries of origin and transit for non-U.S. nationals encountered by CBP. (Sec. 120) This section prohibits the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) from accepting as proof of identification certain documents, such as a warrant issued by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) or an employment authorization issued by DHS. The TSA must collect the biometric information of any individual who (1) seeks to enter the aircraft boarding area of an airport where access is controlled by the TSA, (2) does not present an accepted identification document, and (3) the TSA cannot verify is a U.S. national. The TSA must share this collected biometric information with the Automated Biometric Identification System (IDENT). (Sec. 121) This section prohibits DHS from (1) issuing any COVID-19 vaccine mandate unless expressly authorized by Congress, or (2) taking any adverse action against an employee based solely on the employee's refusal to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. (Sec. 122) This section limits the use of the CBP One mobile application or a similar program. Specifically, DHS may only use such an application for inspecting perishable cargo. (Sec. 124) This section requires the Government Accountability Office to study and report to Congress on the costs incurred by states in support of the federal mission to secure the southwest border and the feasibility of reimbursing states for such costs. (Sec. 125) This section requires the Office of Inspector General of DHS to annually report to Congress on the economic and security impact of mass migration to municipalities and states along the southwest border. (Sec. 126) This section specifies that no funds are authorized to be appropriated for specified DHS activities, including a pilot program for alternatives to detention or purchasing electric vehicles. (Sec. 128) This section requires the Office of Inspector General of DHS to report to Congress an assessment of CBP's ability to mitigate unmanned aircraft systems along the southwest border. DIVISION D--IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS TITLE I--ASYLUM REFORM AND BORDER PROTECTION This title imposes additional requirements for asylum eligibility. (Sec. 101) This section expands provisions that bar certain individuals from applying for asylum. Currently, an individual may not apply for asylum if that individual may be removed to a third country (i.e., a country that is not the applicant's country of nationality or last habitual residence) if that third country has (1) a full and fair asylum process that the individual could use, and (2) an agreement with the United States allowing for such removals. This section expands this provision by authorizing removal to third countries that do not have an agreement with the United States. This section also bars an individual from applying for asylum if the individual traveled through at least one third country before arriving in the United States, with certain exceptions (e.g., the individual applied for and was denied asylum in that third country). (Sec. 102) This section modifies the standard for establishing an asylum applicant's credible fear of persecution. Specifically, to find credible fear, an asylum officer must find that the applicant could more likely than not establish eligibility for asylum. Currently, an asylum officer must conclude that there is a significant possibility that the applicant could establish eligibility for asylum. (Sec. 103) This section limits asylum eligibility to individuals who arrived in the United States at a port of entry. (Sec. 104) This section expands the types of crimes that may make an individual ineligible for asylum, such as a conviction for (1) a misdemeanor relating to the unlawful possession or use of an identification, (2) an offense for driving while intoxicated causing another person's serious bodily injury or death, or (3) any felony. This section further expands this bar to asylum eligibility by broadening the definition of felony to include any crime that is punishable by more than one year of imprisonment. (Some states have misdemeanors that are punishable by imprisonment of more than a year.) Currently, a felony is generally not a bar against asylum eligibility, though certain felonies, such as one for a particularly serious crime, would bar an individual if the individual constitutes a danger to the community. (Sec. 105) This section establishes a duration of six months for an employment authorization for an applicant for asylum. Such an employment authorization may also be renewed for six months or terminated under specified conditions. (Sec. 106) This section requires DHS to charge a fee for each asylum application, except for one filed by an unaccompanied alien child. Currently, DHS is authorized but not required to charge such fees. The section also authorizes DHS to charge fees for a refugee's application for employment authorization or for lawful permanent resident status. (Sec. 107) This section increases the requirements for qualifying as a refugee. Generally, a refugee must have a well-founded fear of persecution based on certain characteristics, such as the individual's race, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. The section establishes additional requirements for meeting these criteria. For example, such persecution may not be based solely on (1) infrequently enforced laws or government policies unless there is credible evidence that the law or policy would be personally applied to the individual, or (2) conduct of rogue government officials acting outside their official capacity. Furthermore, to be a member of a particular social group, the asylum applicant must establish that the group exists independently of the alleged acts of persecution (i.e., the group cannot be defined solely as the victims of the alleged persecution). The section also imposes limits on when DHS or DOJ may exercise discretion in favor of an asylum applicant. For example, favorable discretion may not be exercised, with certain exceptions, for an applicant who (1) has been unlawfully present in the United States for more than one year before applying for asylum; or (2) failed to file federal, state, or local tax returns. (Sec. 108) This section establishes certain situations when an asylum applicant must be considered to have firmly resettled in another country. (Generally, an individual who has firmly resettled in a country that is not their country of nationality is not eligible for asylum.) For example, an individual must be considered to have firmly resettled in another country if, after the events giving rise to the asylum claim, the individual resided in a country where the individual was eligible for any permanent or indefinitely renewable legal immigration status, such as refugee status. (Sec. 109) This section establishes a statutory definition of what constitutes a frivolous asylum application, whereas currently this definition is defined in regulations. Under this bill, an application is frivolous if (1) it is so insufficient in substance that it is clear that it was filed to achieve another objective, such as to delay removal; or (2) any material elements are knowingly fabricated. (Sec. 111) This section requires DOJ to establish procedures to expedite the adjudication of asylum applications from individuals who are (1) subject to formal removal proceedings; and (2) nationals of a Western Hemisphere country subject to sanctions related to Cuba, Nicaragua, or Venezuela. TITLE II--BORDER SAFETY AND MIGRANT PROTECTION (Sec. 201) This section expands the category of non-U.S. nationals who are subject to expedited removal (i.e., removal without further hearing or review) and addresses related issues. Specifically, this section requires expedited removal for individuals who are unlawfully present or who unlawfully entered the United States. (Currently, DHS may, but is not required to, apply expedited removal to unlawfully present individuals who have been physically present in the United States for less than two years.) This section also requires, with certain exceptions, detention for individuals who (1) are subject to expedited removal, (2) are subject to expedited removal and have expressed an intention to apply for asylum, or (3) have established a credible fear of persecution and are awaiting consideration of an asylum application. If DHS cannot comply with this detention requirement or remove an individual to a safe third country, DHS must return the individual to the neighboring country that the individual traveled through to reach the United States while the individual's case is pending. A state may sue DHS to enforce the requirements imposed by this section. This section also authorizes DHS to suspend the introduction of certain non-U.S. nationals at an international border if DHS determines that the suspension is necessary to achieve operational control of that border. (Sec. 202) This section requires DHS to take all actions necessary to reopen or restore all ICE detention facilities that were in operation on January 20, 2021. TITLE III--PREVENTING UNCONTROLLED MIGRATION FLOWS IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE (Sec. 302) This section requires the Department of State to seek to negotiate agreements with Western Hemisphere countries on cooperation and burden sharing on issues related to asylum seekers and immigration. (Sec. 303) This section requires the State Department to periodically brief Congress on the process of its negotiations pursuant to the previous section of this bill. TITLE IV--ENSURING UNITED FAMILIES AT THE BORDER (Sec. 401) This section statutorily establishes that there is no presumption that an alien child (other than an unaccompanied child) should not be detained for immigration purposes. Specifically, the section states that the detention of such minors shall be governed by specified sections of the Immigration and Nationality Act and not any other provision of law, judicial ruling, or settlement agreement. (A 1997 settlement agreement, commonly known as the Flores agreement, imposes requirements relating to the treatment of detained alien minors, including requiring such minors to be released or placed in a nonsecure facility after a certain amount of time in detention.) If an adult enters the United States unlawfully with their child, DHS must detain the adult and child together if the only criminal charge against the adult is for unlawful entry. This section also prohibits states from imposing licensing requirements on immigration detention facilities used to detain minors or families with minors. TITLE V--PROTECTION OF CHILDREN (Sec. 502) This section modifies the treatment of unaccompanied alien children, including by requiring DHS to remove such children, with some exceptions, from the United States. Current law authorizes DHS to remove an unaccompanied alien child to their country of nationality or last habitual residence if that country is next to the United States. This section (1) eliminates the requirement that the country is next to the United States; and (2) requires DHS to remove the child, whereas currently DHS is authorized to do so. This section also authorizes immigration officers to permit such a child to withdraw their application for admission into the United States even if the child is unable to make an independent decision to withdraw the application. This section also establishes and modifies deadlines for the handling of unaccompanied alien children. For example, if the child is a victim of a severe form of human trafficking or has a credible fear of persecution, the child must be placed in formal removal proceedings and have a hearing before an immigration judge within 14 days of screening. Furthermore, before DHS places an unaccompanied alien child with an individual, the Department of Health and Human Services must provide DHS with certain information about the individual, including the individual's social security number and immigration status. DHS must initiate removal proceedings if the individual is unlawfully present. (Sec. 503) This section tightens the eligibility requirements for Special Immigrant Juvenile visas (immigrant visas for qualifying non-U.S. nationals under 21 years of age who are in the United States and have been abused, abandoned, or neglected by a parent). Currently, an otherwise eligible individual may qualify for the visa if the individual cannot reunite with one or both parents due to abuse, neglect, or abandonment (i.e., an individual may qualify even if reunification with one parent is possible). Under this section, an individual shall not qualify for the visa if reunification is possible with any parent or legal guardian. TITLE VI--VISA OVERSTAYS PENALTIES (Sec. 601) This section increases the civil penalties for unlawful entry into the United States and establishes criminal penalties for overstaying a visa. An individual apprehended while unlawfully entering the United States shall be subject to a fine of at least $500 and up to $1,000 (currently at least $50 and up to $250). If an individual overstays a visa (or otherwise fails to comply with the conditions of a visa) for 10 days or more, on first offense the individual shall be subject to fines or imprisonment for up to six months, or both. For subsequent violations, the individual shall be subject to fines or imprisonment of up to two years, or both. TITLE VII--IMMIGRATION PAROLE REFORM (Sec. 701) This section limits the authority of DHS to grant parole (temporary admission into the United States for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit that is granted on a case-by-case basis). Under this section, DHS may not grant parole based on eligibility criteria describing an entire class of potential parole recipients. This section restricts DHS from granting parole to non-U.S. nationals who are already in the United States, with specified exceptions, such as for certain individuals who already have an approved petition for a family-sponsored visa and are the spouse or child of an active duty member of the Armed Forces. The section further restricts the authority of DHS to grant parole, including by limiting (1) what constitutes granting parole on a case-by-case basis, (2) the authority to grant parole to purposes laid out in the section, and (3) the length of the parole period that may be granted to an individual. (Sec. 702) This title takes effect 30 days after enactment of this bill, with specified exceptions. (Sec. 703) This section authorizes persons (individuals or entities), states, and local governments to sue the federal government for failing to comply with this title's requirements if the person or government bringing the lawsuit suffered at least $1,000 of financial harm as a result of the failure.",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,DOS,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

Partner countries must be democratic countries with advanced technology sectors that have a demonstrated record of trust or an expressed interest in international cooperation and coordination with the United States on defense and intelligence matters. The bill also establishes the International Technology Partnership Fund in the Department of the Treasury. The State Department may use amounts from this fund to support joint research projects from International Technology Partnership member countries and technology investments in third-country markets.

(Sec. 102) The Secure Embassy Construction and Counterterrorism Act of 1999 is amended to require: (1) U.S. diplomatic mission emergency action plans to include the threat from complex attacks, and (2) rapid response procedures to include options for deployment of additional military resources, including deployment at high risk, high threat posts. (Sec. 103) The Diplomatic Security Act is amended to require an accountability review board to recommend investigatory or disciplinary action if an individual's misconduct or unsatisfactory performance significantly contributed to serious injury, loss of life, significant property destruction, or a serious security breach at or related to a U.S. government mission abroad. Subtitle B--Physical Security and Personnel Requirements (Sec. 111) It is the sense of Congress that the Capital Security Cost Sharing Program should prioritize the construction of new facilities and the maintenance of existing facilities at high risk, high threat posts.

(Sec. 112) The Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991 is amended to authorize the State Department to award local guard contracts for a Foreign Service building on the basis of best value (as determined by a cost-technical trade off analysis). (Sec. 113) The Foreign Service Buildings Act, 1926 is amended to authorize the State Department to transfer certain FY2018 appropriations if necessary to implement the recommendations of the Benghazi Accountability Review Board or to prevent or respond to security situations and requirements. (Sec. 114) The State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 is amended to authorize the State Department to provide physical security enhancements at overseas educational facilities established for the children of U.S. government employees. (Sec. 115) A determination to use procedures other than competitive procedures to meet emergency security requirements, including physical security upgrades, protective equipment, and other immediate threat mitigation projects, shall not be subject to certain challenges. (Sec. 116) It is the sense of Congress that: (1) the Overseas Security Policy Board's security standards for facilities should apply to all facilities, and (2) such facilities should comply with waiver or exception requirements if in the U.S. national interest. (Sec. 117) The State Department shall station key personnel for sustained periods of time at high risk, high threat posts in order to: (1) establish institutional knowledge and situational awareness that would allow for a fuller familiarization with the local political and security environment, and (2) ensure that necessary security procedures are implemented. (Sec. 118) The State Department shall submit to Congress a comprehensive report regarding ongoing embassy construction projects and major embassy security upgrade projects. (Sec. 119) The State Department may improve or construct facilities overseas for other federal agencies on an advance-of-funds or reimbursable basis if such advances or reimbursements are credited to the Embassy Security, Construction, and Maintenance account and remain available until expended.

(Sec. 204) The IG shall report to Congress regarding the requirement to audit the operations of each Foreign Service post and each bureau or other State Department office. (Sec. 205) It is the sense of Congress that the State Department has not implemented all of the recommendations made by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the IG related to embassy security and that some recommendations may yield potentially significant cost savings. (Sec. 206) The Inspector General of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) shall limit the payment of special differentials to USAID Foreign Service criminal investigators to specified levels, retroactive to January 1, 2013. TITLE III--INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS (Sec. 301) The State Department shall submit to Congress a U.S. strategy and implementation plan for combating sexual exploitation and abuse in U.N. peacekeeping operations. (Sec. 302) The bill expresses U.S. policy regarding the formula for determining the troop reimbursement rate paid to troop- and police-contributing countries for U.N. peacekeeping operations. (Sec. 303) It is U.S. policy that security assistance should not be provided to any unit of a foreign security force that has engaged in a gross violation of human rights or in acts of sexual exploitation or abuse, including while serving in a U.N. peacekeeping operation. (Sec. 304) The State Department shall urge the United Nations (U.N.) to share the raw data used to calculate member state peacekeeping assessment rates and to make such formula available. (Sec. 305) The President shall seek to obtain a U.N. commitment to make available to the United States any peacekeeping credits from a closed peacekeeping operation. (Sec. 306) The United Nations Participation Act of 1945 is amended to revise the requirements of the President's report on U.S. contributions to U.N. peacekeeping operations. (Sec. 307) The bill sets forth provisions with respect to whistle-blower protections for U.N. personnel.

All applicants for such a visa must establish that the applicant was employed with the U.S. government or a NATO mission for one year, where currently some applicants must prove two years of employment. This section also eliminates a requirement that the applicant faces an ongoing serious threat in Afghanistan due to such employment. Furthermore, for an applicant qualifying for a visa by performing duties for U.S. military personnel stationed with a NATO mission, this section eliminates a requirement that the duties performed qualify as sensitive and trusted duties. This section also relaxes limits to appealing rejections for applications for such visas. (Sec. 402) This bill authorizes the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to jointly postpone the medical exam requirement for individuals seeking entry into the United States under the program described in Section 401.

Such an individual's status as a lawful permanent resident shall be conditional until the individual undergoes the required medical exam. (Sec. 403) This section modifies the immigration benefits of the surviving family members of certain deceased individuals.

This section also expands surviving family member benefits for certain programs that provide special immigrant status to eligible nationals of Afghanistan or Iraq, including the program described in Section 401. Specifically, if an individual submitted an application to the Chief of Mission that included an accompanying spouse or child and that application would have been approved but for the individual's death, the surviving spouse or child shall remain eligible to receive a visa under the respective program. Currently, such survivor rights only apply if the deceased individual's petition was approved. (Sec. 404) If an individual has an approved petition under a program that provided special immigrant status to translators who worked for the Armed Forces in Afghanistan or Iraq but a visa is not immediately available, the State Department or DHS may convert that petition to an approved petition under another program which provides special immigrant status to certain Iraqi nationals, if there are visas available under that second program. (DHS and the State Department currently only have the authority to convert petitions filed before October 1, 2008.) TITLE V--DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE This title provides appropriations to the Department of Justice (DOJ) for state and local law enforcement assistance.

DIVISION A--LIMIT FEDERAL SPENDING TITLE I--DISCRETIONARY SPENDING LIMITS FOR DISCRETIONARY CATEGORY (Sec. 101) This section establishes new discretionary spending limits (also known as spending caps) for FY2024 and FY2025 that are enforced with sequestration (i.e., automatic, across-the-board spending reductions). The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has estimated that the spending limits will reduce spending below the levels included in its baseline projections. In addition, this section extends and establishes new limits for several adjustments to discretionary spending limits that are permitted under current law to accommodate additional appropriations for certain activities. These adjustments apply to spending for continuing disability reviews and redeterminations, health care fraud and abuse control, and reemployment services and eligibility assessments. The section also extends the adjustment to discretionary spending limits for disaster relief funding. The limits for this adjustment are based on a statutory formula, which is modified by this section. During FY2026-FY2029, if the annual budget resolution has not been adopted by Congress by April 15, this section requires the chairman of the House Budget Committee to submit to the House a spending allocation for the House Appropriations Committee that is consistent with levels specified in this section. Finally, the section provides funding for (1) the Department of Veterans Affairs Cost of War Toxic Exposures Fund, and (2) the Department of Commerce Nonrecurring Expenses Fund. (Sec. 102) This section requires the discretionary spending limits to be revised if a continuing resolution (CR) is in effect at the beginning of the calendar year. Specifically, if a CR for FY2024 or FY2025 is in effect on or after January 1 of 2024 or 2025 for any discretionary budget account, the discretionary spending limits for that fiscal year must be revised to specified levels. CBO has estimated that the revised limits will be lower for defense spending and higher for nondefense spending compared to the original limits. If all of the regular appropriations bills for the fiscal year are enacted before April 30, the revised limits revert to the original limits. If a CR is in effect on April 30 of 2024 or 2025, a final sequestration order must be issued based on the revised limits. (Sec. 103) This section exempts specified funds that were previously designated as emergency spending from the discretionary spending limits. TITLE II--BUDGET ENFORCEMENT IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES (Sec. 111) This section requires the chairman of the House Budget Committee to submit for publication in the Congressional Record FY2024 committee allocations, aggregate spending levels, and aggregate revenue levels consistent with this division. The allocations, aggregates, and levels submitted by the chairman are enforceable in the House of Representatives as if they were included in a FY2024 congressional budget resolution. The chairman may adjust the levels to reflect (1) changes resulting from CBO's updates to it baseline for FY2024-FY2033, or (2) legislation that would not increase the deficit over either FY2024-FY2028 or FY2024-FY2033. This section expires if Congress agrees to a budget resolution for FY2024. (Sec. 112) This section sets forth limitations that apply to advance appropriations in the House of Representatives. (Sec. 113) This section specifies that this title is enacted under the rulemaking powers of the House of Representatives and will be considered part of the rules of the House. It also recognizes that the House has the authority to change these rules. TITLE III--BUDGET ENFORCEMENT IN THE SENATE (Sec. 121) This section requires the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee to submit for publication in the Congressional Record FY2024 committee allocations, aggregate spending and revenue levels, and levels of Social Security revenues and outlays consistent with this division. The chairman may also include the deficit neutral reserve fund contained in the FY2022 budget resolution, updated by two fiscal years. The allocations, aggregates, and levels submitted by the chairman are enforceable in the Senate as if they were included in a FY2024 congressional budget resolution. This section expires if Congress agrees to a budget resolution for FY2024. (Sec. 122) After April 15, 2024, but not later than May 15, 2024, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee must submit for publication in the Congressional Record FY2025 committee allocations, aggregate spending and revenue levels, and levels of Social Security revenues and outlays consistent with this division. The chairman may also include the deficit neutral reserve fund contained in the FY2022 budget resolution, updated by three fiscal years. After April 15, 2024, the allocations, aggregates, and levels submitted by the chairman are enforceable in the Senate as if they were included in a FY2025 congressional budget resolution. This section expires if Congress agrees to a budget resolution for FY2025. (Sec. 123) This section sets forth limitations and budget enforcement procedures that apply to advance appropriations in the Senate. (Sec. 124) This section specifies that this title is enacted under the rulemaking powers of the Senate and will be considered part of the rules of the Senate. It also recognizes that the Senate has the authority to change these rules.

TITLE III--STATUTORY ADMINISTRATIVE PAY-AS-YOU-GO Administrative Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2023 This title provides statutory authority for the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) administrative pay-as-you-go procedures. (Sec. 263) This section requires federal agencies to submit at least one proposal to reduce direct spending (i.e., mandatory spending) before taking a discretionary administrative action that increases direct spending. The proposed reduction must be greater than or equal to the increase in direct spending attributable to the administrative action. Further, if an agency determines an administrative action that increases direct spending is required by law, and therefore not subject to these requirements, the agency must submit to the OMB (1) its legal basis for concluding that the action is not discretionary, and (2) the projected increase in direct spending under the least costly implementation option that is reasonably identifiable. (Sec. 264) This section requires the OMB to issue administrative guidance regarding these requirements. (Sec. 265) This section permits the OMB to waive these requirements if a waiver is necessary for (1) the delivery of essential services, or (2) effective program delivery. (Sec. 266) This section exempts administrative actions from these requirements if the direct spending cost of the action is less than (1) $1 billion over the 10-year period beginning with the current year, or (2) $100 million in any given year over such period. (Sec. 267) Determinations, findings, and actions related to these requirements are not subject to judicial review. (Sec. 268) These requirements expire on December 31, 2024. (Sec. 269) The Government Accountability Office (GAO) must report on the implementation of these requirements. (Sec. 270) The GAO also must include an assessment of an agency's compliance with these requirements in its report for a major rule under the Congressional Review Act. TITLE IV--TERMINATION OF SUSPENSION OF PAYMENTS ON FEDERAL STUDENT LOANS; RESUMPTION OF ACCRUAL OF INTEREST AND COLLECTIONS (Sec. 271) This section terminates the suspension of (1) federal student loan payments, (2) the application of a 0% interest rate on these loans, and (3) involuntary collections on these loans. This termination takes effect 60 days after June 30, 2023. The section also prohibits the Department of Education from implementing any executive action or rule that extends any of these suspensions unless the action is expressly authorized by Congress. DIVISION C--GROW THE ECONOMY TITLE I--TEMPORARY ASSISTANCE TO NEEDY FAMILIES This title makes various changes to the work requirements and other aspects of the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program. (Sec. 301) This section changes the comparison year for calculating the caseload reduction credit from FY2005 to FY2015. Under current law, states must meet a mandatory work participation rate by ensuring that a specified percentage of families that receive TANF assistance participate in work-related activities. However, a state may earn a caseload reduction credit to lower that rate by reducing its caseload of families receiving TANF assistance as compared to its caseload in FY2005. This section changes the comparison year to FY2015. (Sec. 302) This section requires the Department of Health and Human Services to award grants to up to five states for piloting alternative ways to measure the states' performance in improving employment and earnings outcomes and other indicators of family stability and well-being for TANF recipients. (Sec. 303) This section restricts a practice whereby some states provide a limited amount of TANF assistance to families as a supplement to benefits that the families receive under another program, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and then count those families when determining the work participation rate. Specifically, the section requires that states must provide those families with a benefit of at least $35 per month (funded with state expenditures) in order to count the families when determining the work participation rate. (Sec. 304) This section requires states to report metrics related to the employment and educational outcomes of individuals who exit the TANF program. Specifically, states must report on the employment rate for individuals in unsubsidized employment following their exit from the program and their median earnings. Additionally, states must report on the percentage of individuals under age 24 who obtain a high school degree or equivalent while in the TANF program or within a year of their exit. (Sec. 305) This section makes the changes to the TANF program generally effective on October 1, 2024. However, changes affecting the caseload reduction credit and the provision of limited TANF assistance are effective on October 1, 2025. TITLE II--SNAP EXEMPTIONS (Sec. 311) This section expands applicability of the work requirements for SNAP recipients who are able-bodied adults without dependents (ABAWDs). (SNAP recipients who are ABAWDs have work-related requirements in addition to the general SNAP work registration and employment and training requirements.) Specifically, this section applies the work requirements for ABAWDs to adults who are not over 51 years old in FY2023, not over 53 years old in FY2024, and not over 55 years old in FY2025 and every year thereafter. Under current law, these requirements apply to adults who are not over 50 years old. These provisions go into effect 90 days after enactment and sunset on October 1, 2030. Also, the section exempts from the ABAWD work requirements homeless individuals, veterans, and certain individuals who were previously in foster care and are 24 years old or younger. (Sec. 312) This section prohibits a state agency from accumulating unused exemptions to the ABAWD work requirement and providing them to eligible SNAP recipients beyond the subsequent fiscal year. Currently, for each fiscal year, a state agency may exempt a certain number of SNAP recipients from the ABAWD work requirements; unused exemptions may be carried over and used in a subsequent fiscal year. Under this section, an unused exemption may not be carried over for more than one year. Further, this section reduces the percentage of exemptions a state agency may provide each year so that the average monthly number of exemptions does not exceed 8% of covered individuals (i.e., SNAP recipients and certain individuals who were denied SNAP benefits due to the work requirements). Under current law, a state is eligible for exemptions for up to 12% of covered individuals. These provisions apply to FY2024 and each subsequent fiscal year. (Sec. 313) This section expands the purpose of SNAP to include assisting low-income adults in obtaining employment and increasing their earnings. (Sec. 314) This section requires USDA to make public all available state requests for waivers from the SNAP ABAWD work requirements and the approvals of the requests within 30 days of enactment; this includes making public all supporting data from the state about the request and relevant documentation on the utilization of waivers. This waiver program allows the Food and Nutrition Service to provide a state exemptions from SNAP ABAWD work requirements based on a determination that an area (1) has an unemployment rate of over 10%, or (2) does not have a sufficient number of jobs. TITLE III--PERMITTING REFORM (Sec. 321) This section modifies provisions under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), including by limiting the scope of the administrative review of major federal actions. Under NEPA, agencies must conduct an environmental assessment (EA) to determine if a proposed federal action will have significant environmental impacts. If the EA determines that such impacts will be significant, then the agency must submit an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). The EIS must include a range of alternatives to the proposed action. Among other elements, the section defines a major federal action to be an action that an agency determines is subject to substantial federal control and responsibility. The definition explicitly excludes certain actions from NEPA requirements, such as a nonfederal action with minimal federal funding or involvement. This section limits the scope of an EIS review to reasonably foreseeable environmental effects of the proposed agency action. The section also provides threshold determinations for when an agency is not required to prepare an environmental document under NEPA, such as when categorical exclusions (including those adopted from another agency) apply. The section limits alternatives in an EIS to a reasonable range. Further, the alternatives included in the EIS must be technically and economically feasible. Additionally, an EA or EIS must also be under the page limits established by the section. The section also requires a lead agency to be designated when more than one agency is participating in a proposed action. The lead agency must supervise the preparation of one environmental document (e.g., EIS) and prepare a schedule to complete the review of the action. The lead agency must complete the EA or EIS within deadlines established by the section but may extend the deadline to provide additional time as is necessary. Additionally, a project sponsor may file a written petition to seek a court order to set forth a schedule and deadline for the agency if the agency has failed to act. A lead agency must prescribe procedures to allow a project sponsor to prepare an EA or EIS under the supervision of the agency. The section also provides guidelines for the (1) use of analysis from a previously reviewed programmatic environmental document in a subsequent document for a specified time period, and (2) adoption of another agency's categorical exclusions for proposed agency actions. Under this section, the Council on Environmental Quality must study and report on the potential for online and digital technologies to address delays in reviews and improve public accessibility and transparency related to NEPA requirements. (Sec. 322) This section requires the Electric Reliability Organization to study the total transfer capability between transmission planning regions. Generally, total transfer capability means the amount of electric power that can be moved or transferred reliably from one area to another area of the interconnected transmission systems by way of all transmission lines (or paths) between those areas under specified system conditions. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission must publish the study and seek public comments. (Sec. 323) This section designates energy storage projects as covered projects under the Fixing America's Surface Transportation (FAST) Act. Such projects qualify for expedited environmental review. (Sec. 324) This section ratifies and approves all authorizations, permits, verifications, extensions, biological opinions, incidental take statements, and other approvals or orders issued for the construction and initial operation of the Mountain Valley Pipeline (a natural gas pipeline located in Virginia and West Virginia). The section directs all applicable agencies to continue to maintain such authorizations issued for the construction and operation of the pipeline. Additionally, this section exempts all such authorizations from judicial review, regardless of the issue date, and including pending lawsuits. The section requires the Department of the Army to issue within 21 days all permits or verifications necessary to (1) complete the construction of the pipeline across the waters of the United States, and (2) allow for the operation and maintenance of the pipeline.
